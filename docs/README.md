## Task Format Reference

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[T]`  | Todo    |
| `[D]`  | Deadline |
| `[E]`  | Event   |
| `[X]`  | Done    |
| `[ ]`  | Not done |

---

## Data Storage

Tasks are automatically saved to `./data/duke.txt` whenever you add, delete, mark, or unmark a task. The file is re-loaded when Mercury starts, so your tasks persist between sessions.

If the data file is missing (e.g., first launch), Mercury starts with an empty list.

---

## Error Handling

Mercury provides clear error messages for invalid input:

- Wrong command name → tells you which word it did not understand
- Missing task number for `mark`/`unmark`/`delete` → prompts you to provide one
- Invalid date format for `deadline` → reminds you to use `yyyy-mm-dd`
- Non-existent dates (e.g., `2026-02-30`) → flagged as invalid
- Duplicate tasks → rejected with a descriptive message

---

## Deployment

To build the JAR yourself from source:

1. Ensure **Java 21** and **Gradle** are installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
3. Run:
   ```
   ./gradlew shadowJar
   ```
4. The JAR will be generated at `build/libs/mercury.jar`.
5. Run it with:
   ```
   java -jar build/libs/mercury.jar
   ```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use the app from the command line?**
Yes. Run `java -jar mercury.jar` and interact via the terminal using the same commands.

**Q: Where is my data saved?**
In `./data/duke.txt`, relative to the folder you ran the JAR from.

**Q: What happens if the data file is corrupted?**
Mercury skips unreadable lines and starts fresh. You may lose tasks from a corrupted file.

**Q: Can I have two tasks with the same description?**
No. Mercury prevents exact duplicates to avoid confusion.

## Data Storage

### Automatic Saving

- Task data is saved automatically to `data/vinux.txt`
- Expense data is saved automatically to `data/expenses.txt`
- No manual saving required!

### Editing Data Files

⚠️ **Not recommended for most users!**

Data is stored as text files in the `data` folder:
- `vinux.txt` - your tasks
- `expenses.txt` - your expenses

While you can edit these files directly, incorrect formatting will cause data loss. Only edit if you know what you're doing!

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

A: Copy the entire `data` folder from your Vinux home folder to the same location on the new computer.

**Q: Can I use Vinux without the GUI?**

A: Yes! Run `java -jar vinux.jar` in a terminal and use the command-line interface.

**Q: What happens if I add a duplicate task?**

A: Vinux will warn you but still add it. You can delete duplicates manually.

**Q: The window is too small, can I resize it?**

A: Yes! Drag the window edges to resize. The content will adjust automatically.
